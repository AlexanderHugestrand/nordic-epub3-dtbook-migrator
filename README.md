Nordic EPUB3/DTBook Migrator
============================

This project includes two Pipeline 2 modules:

 * EPUB3 to DTBook
 * DTBook to EPUB3

The grammar used in the EPUB3 and DTBook files is a strict subset of EPUB3 and DTBook, and is defined in the nordic markup guidelines.

The two converters are mainly implemented using XSLT, but XProc is used to make it easy to work with EPUB3 files, as well as to make the converter available through Pipeline 2.
