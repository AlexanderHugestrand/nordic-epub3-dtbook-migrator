                    <span id="doc1_dtb10" class="sentence">Valentin Haüy (1745-1821), of many called the father of the education of the blind, founded a school for blind children of both sexes in
                        Paris in 1785. </span>
                    <span id="doc1_dtb11" class="sentence">In 1786 he published the first known book about education for the blind. </span>
                    <span id="doc1_dtb12" class="sentence">His main idea was the necessity of educating the blind to an independent life. </span>
                    <span id="doc1_dtb13" class="sentence">Thus the blind were trained for different professions such as printing, basket making, sewing etc. </span>
                    <span id="doc1_dtb14" class="sentence">Another of Haüys ideas was that blind children should not be segregated but educated together with sighted children. </span>
                    <span id="doc1_dtb15" class="sentence">His method of printing books with letters in relief and ink-print was a minor revolution that enabled the blind to read books. </span>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span id="doc1_dtb16" class="sentence">In the study a hitherto unknown period in Haüys life is described. </span>
                    <span id="doc1_dtb17" class="sentence">It is the period 1807-1820 which he spent in St Petersburg, then the capital of Russia. </span>
                    <span id="doc1_dtb18" class="sentence">In the study there is also an analysis of Haüy’s influence on the education of the blind in other European countries. </span>

                            <span id="doc4_dtb682" class="sentence">Basket-making and straw plaiting for chair bottoms were taught at the institute; the girls learned how to make hairnets and to knit. </span>

                            <span id="doc4_dtb694" class="sentence">These notes proved that the original intention was to admit two categories of pupils to the institute: the poor, who would learn
                                reading, writing, typesetting, music and handicrafts, and the well-to-do, who would learn writing, geography, poetry, etc. </span>

                            <span id="doc4_dtb697" class="sentence">He was also very critical of Haüy, who he found had made improper use of his position by appropriating the best rooms for his own

                        (1811-1817). </span>

                    <span id="doc6_dtb1003" class="sentence">One illustration of his lack of knowledge of Russian society is that he tried to teach blind students to play the organ while in St
                        Petersburg, in his ignorance of the fact that organ music does not form part of the Greek Orthodox Church's rites. </span>
