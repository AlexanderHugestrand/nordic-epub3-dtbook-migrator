            <span id="doc1_dtb10">Valentin Haüy (1745-1821), of many called the father of the education of the blind, founded a school for blind children of both sexes in Paris in 1785. </span>
            <span id="doc1_dtb11">In 1786 he published the first known book about education for the blind. </span>
            <span id="doc1_dtb12">His main idea was the necessity of educating the blind to an independent life. </span>
            <span id="doc1_dtb13">Thus the blind were trained for different professions such as printing, basket making, sewing etc. </span>
            <span id="doc1_dtb14">Another of Haüys ideas was that blind children should not be segregated but educated together with sighted children. </span>
            <span id="doc1_dtb15">His method of printing books with letters in relief and ink-print was a minor revolution that enabled the blind to read books. </span>
         </p>
         <p>
            <span id="doc1_dtb16">In the study a hitherto unknown period in Haüys life is described. </span>
            <span id="doc1_dtb17">It is the period 1807-1820 which he spent in St Petersburg, then the capital of Russia. </span>
            <span id="doc1_dtb18">In the study there is also an analysis of Haüy’s influence on the education of the blind in other European countries. </span>

            <h2 id="doc1_d910e619">Preface</h2>
            <p>
               <span id="doc1_dtb113">During my 19 years at the Swedish Library of Talking Books and Braille (<abbr title="The Swedish Library of Talking Books and Braille" id="doc1_d910e629"
                     epub:type="z3998:acronym" class="spell-out">MTM</abbr>), I have frequently been asked about the history of the Braille system and these questions were really what motivated my
                  research into the life of Louis Braille, the inventor of the system of writing for the blind which was named after him. </span>
               <span id="doc1_dtb114">My investigations revealed that Louis Braille himself would have had almost no schooling at all if it had not been for Valentin Haüy, the father of education for
                  the blind.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
               <span id="doc1_dtb115">As there is very little literature available in Swedish on either Valentin Haüy or Louis Braille, the two principle figures in the history of education for the
                  blind, I decided to do something to remedy this. </span>
               <span id="doc1_dtb116">I starrrrted with Louis Braille, the inventor of the system of writing for the blind which is in use today, and when I had finished my studies of Braille's life,
                  I naturally went on to investigate the life of Valentin Haüy. </span>
               <span id="doc1_dtb117">At the time I had to write a paper on education for the blind, as part of my studies at the Department of Education (Stockholm university), so I decided to kill
                  two birds with one stone and combine both tasks.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
               <span id="doc1_dtb118">Working on this paper was no easy task as so few sources can be consulted in Sweden. </span>
               <span id="doc1_dtb119">There is an international lending network, but borrowing books is a slow process since foreign libraries do not always deliver by airmail. </span>
               <span id="doc1_dtb120">My principal source was thus the library at the Danish Museum of the Blind, originally the library of the Royal Institute for the Blind. </span>
               <span id="doc1_dtb121">It was there that I came across a copy of Haüy's first book on education for the blind.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
               <span id="doc1_dtb122">I particularly wish to thank Mogens Bang, head of the Danish Museum of the Blind, who made it possible for me to spend time in the museum sifting through the
                  material in their unique collection of older books on education for the blind.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
               <span id="doc1_dtb123">I would also like to thank Marie Strömbäck and Kerstin Wallin, who helped me with the translations from French. </span>
               <span id="doc1_dtb124">Finally, I am much obliged to Eric Engström, my tutor, for inspiring and encouraging me in my work.</span>

         <p>
            <span id="doc2_dtb128">My interest in Valentin Haüy, the father of education for the blind in Europe, was aroused while working at <abbr
                  title="The Swedish Library of Talking Books and Braille" id="doc2_d910e709" epub:type="z3998:acronym" class="spell-out">MTM</abbr> on a book about Louis Braille, the creator of the
               Braille system. </span>
            <span id="doc2_dtb129">I discovered that there was a dearth of literature on Haüy in Swedish, and that in the limited literature I was able to consult, information about him was often
               contradictory. </span>
            <span id="doc2_dtb130">In particular, I noticed that there were no references to the period of the more than ten years which Haüy spent in Russia.</span>
         </p>
         <p>
            <span id="doc2_dtb131">In this paper I have proposed a number of research questions:</span>
         </p>
         <ul id="doc2_dtb132">
            <li id="doc2_d910e728">
               <span id="doc2_dtb133">Who was Valentin Haüy? </span>
               <span id="doc2_dtb134">What do we know about his life?</span>
            </li>
            <li id="doc2_d910e737">
               <span id="doc2_dtb135">What role did he play in the creation of special education for the blind?</span>
            </li>
            <li id="doc2_d910e743">
               <span id="doc2_dtb136">Was he really "the father of education for the blind" or were there others who merit that distinction?</span>
            </li>
            <li id="doc2_d910e749">
               <span id="doc2_dtb137">How great was his influence on the introduction of education for the blind in Sweden and other countries?</span>
            </li>
            <li id="doc2_d910e755">
               <span id="doc2_dtb138">What were his teaching methods?</span>
            </li>
            <li id="doc2_d910e762">
               <span id="doc2_dtb139">What happened during his stay in Russia - did he in fact found an institute for the blind in St Petersburg?</span>
            </li>

         <h1 id="doc3_d910e772">2. Purpose, method and sources</h1>
         <p>
            <span id="doc3_dtb142">My purpose in this paper is to shed some light on Valentin Haüy, the person, and the role he played in the history of education for the blind, and to attempt to
               ascertain whether he was influential in the introduction of education for the blind in other countries, particularly in Sweden.</span>
         </p>
         <p>
            <span id="doc3_dtb143">For obvious reasons, I have chosen a hermeneutic method. </span>
            <span id="doc3_dtb144">I was unable, of course, to interview Valentin Haüy in person; he has been dead for nearly 200 years. </span>
            <span id="doc3_dtb145">Initially, I had in mind the idea of adopting an idiographic approach to my investigation but found this difficult to apply to an historical personage such as Haüy. </span>
            <span id="doc3_dtb146">However, it was, above all, the lack of first-hand sources which most discouraged me.</span>
         </p>
         <p>
            <span id="doc3_dtb147">In historical research, one must have access to the remains or traces of "reality in the past tense," as Sjöstrand (1972) put it. </span>
            <span id="doc3_dtb148">The researcher pieces together, in a manner of speaking, a mosaic from the fragments he manages to find. </span>
            <span id="doc3_d910e810">
               <span id="doc3_dtb149">These remains and traces may be many and varied; in the case of Haüy, they are mainly written sources </span>
               <a id="doc3_dtb150" epub:type="noteref" href="#doc7_fn_1">1</a>
               <span id="doc3_dtb151">.</span>
            </span>
         </p>
         <p>
            <span id="doc3_dtb152">One of the purposes of this paper is to create a portrait in writing of Valentin Haüy. </span>
            <span id="doc3_dtb153">In other words, a biography. </span>
            <span id="doc3_d910e831">
               <span id="doc3_dtb154">When writing a biography, one should make use of material which directly or indirectly, in part or completely provides information about the life of one or
                  several people </span>
               <a id="doc3_dtb155" epub:type="noteref" href="#doc7_fn_2">2</a>
               <span id="doc3_dtb156">. </span>
            </span>
            <span id="doc3_dtb157">This may or may not be written material. </span>
            <span id="doc3_dtb158">Written material produced by the investigated person himself or herself is, according to Engström, "first-person documentation," while material about the person
               investigated is "third-person documentation". </span>
            <span id="doc3_d910e850">
               <span id="doc3_dtb159">The lack of first-hand sources naturally means that the validity of this type of documentation is questionable </span>
               <a id="doc3_dtb160" epub:type="noteref" href="#doc7_fn_3">3</a>
               <span id="doc3_dtb161">. </span>
            </span>
            <span id="doc3_dtb162">However, some of the documentation I have used does in fact quote from first-hand sources or "first-person documents". </span>
            <span id="doc3_dtb163">To judge from the literature available on the subject, I am one of the very few (if not the only) researchers who have used Skrébitsky as a source.</span>
         </p>
         <span id="doc3_page_6" class="page-normal" epub:type="pagebreak" title="6"></span>
         <p>
            <span id="doc3_dtb164">I did have access to a single first-hand source - the information I use to describe Haüy's pedagogical methods was, in part, gleaned from his own Essai sur
               l'Education des Aveugles.</span>
         </p>
         <p>
            <span id="doc3_dtb165">I have hunted for sources in museums and archives where most of the material available was in printed form. </span>
            <span id="doc3_dtb166">The few hand-written documents in existence are in the possession of the Association Valentin Haüy in Paris.</span>
         </p>
         <p>
            <span id="doc3_dtb167">Most of the documents I have used for this paper are in the library at the Danish Museum of the Blind, which is the only Nordic library that possesses a copy of
               Valentin Haüy's Essai de l'Education des Jeunes Aveugles, together with the Institution des Jeunes Aveugles' annual reports. </span>
            <span id="doc3_dtb168">One of these reports merits special attention since it contains a relatively early biographical article on Valentin Haüy written by the director of the institute, Dr
               P-A Dufau. </span>
            <span id="doc3_dtb169">The report is dated 1852, when the institute transferred to its present location in the Boulevard des Invalides. </span>
            <span id="doc3_dtb170">The article in question was written in 1844 and was published separately. </span>
            <span id="doc3_dtb171">Dufau's main source is a letter written by Valentin Haüy to his son.</span>
         </p>
         <p>
            <span id="doc3_dtb172">Paul Henri, head of the Association Valentin Haüy in the 1950s, in his biography of Louis Braille (The Life and Work of Louis Braille 1809-1852) dedicated an ample
               section to Valentin Haüy and his pioneering work in the field of education for the blind. </span>
            <span id="doc3_dtb173">His biography first appeared in France in the 1950s in a Braille version and was later, on the decision of the World Blind Union, translated into English and
               published by the South African National Council for the Blind in 1987. </span>
            <span id="doc3_dtb174">According to Didier-Weygand (2000), Henri also published a separate biography of Valentin Haüy (Paris, 1984), but unfortunately this information reached me only when
               the present paper was to all intents and purposes completed.</span>
         </p>
         <p>
            <span id="doc3_dtb175">Existing literature tends to ignore Valentin Haüy's stay in St Petersburg. so I have paid particular attention to that period in his life. </span>
            <span id="doc3_dtb176">A valuable source was the Russian ophtalmologist Alexander Skrébitsky's little publication, Valentin Haüy à St. </span>
            <span id="doc3_dtb177">Petersbourg (1884). </span>
            <span id="doc3_dtb178">Skrébitsky can be said to have rediscovered Haüy in Russia during his own attempts to improve conditions for the blind. </span>
            <span id="doc3_dtb179">Haüy's institute for the blind in St Petersburg had by then been closed and forgotten for many years, but Skrébitsky found material in its archives on which he based
               his book. </span>
            <span id="doc3_dtb180">There was, for example, a box full of documents dating from the period 1807-1809, but only a few documents from the latter part of Haüy's stay in Russia. </span>
            <span id="doc3_d910e939">
               <span id="doc3_dtb181">Skrébitsky managed to smuggle the box out of Russia and donated it to the Valentin Haüy Museum in Paris where it is still kept </span>
               <a id="doc3_dtb182" epub:type="noteref" href="#doc7_fn_4">4</a>
               <span id="doc3_dtb183">. </span>
            </span>
            <span id="doc3_dtb184">I have been able to ascertain that this information is correct, but have not had the opportunity to consult these documents personally. </span>
            <span id="doc3_dtb185">I trust that Skrébitsky's quotations from them are accurate.</span>
         </p>
         <p>
            <span id="doc3_dtb186">The French historian Zina Weygand published a booklet entitled Les Temps des Fondateurs 1784-1844 for the second Congress on the history of the blind in Paris in
               1998. </span>
            <span id="doc3_dtb187">Her booklet is interesting as she had access to the archives of the Institution des Jeunes Aveugles (INJA) created by Valentin Haüy, the Bibliothèque National de
               France, the Bibliothèque Association Valentin Haüy, as well as those of the Archive du C.N.H.O. des Quinze-Vingt. </span>
            <span id="doc3_dtb188">Her booklet is only a foretaste of her doctoral thesis, La Cécité et les Aveugles dans la Société Française: Représentations et Institution du Moyen Âge aux
               Premières Années du XIX Siècle, published in March 2000. </span>
            <span id="doc3_dtb189">Weygand married shortly after the Paris Congress and now uses a double surname, Didier-Weygand. </span>
            <span id="doc3_dtb190">Her sources include documents from archives, press cuttings and documents and letters written by Haüy himself. </span>
            <span id="doc3_dtb191">She is the only researcher to have made use of the minutes kept by the various revolutionary committees in Paris during the 1790s. </span>
            <span id="doc3_dtb192">She does not, however, write about Haüy's years in Russia.</span>

                  <span id="doc4_dtb208">The debate on the social value of the handicapped and their learning capacity began with John Locke (1632-1704) and his essay "The Molyneux Problem," included
                     in "An Essay Concerning Human Understanding" </span>

               </span>
               <span id="doc4_dtb211">Locke received a letter from William Molyneux, an Irishman, dated 2nd March 1693, in which the following question was posed: "If a person who was born blind, and
                  who has learnt to distinguish by touch between a cube and a sphere regains vision after an operation, will he then be able to distinguish the cube from the sphere by sight alone?" </span>

            <p>
               <span id="doc4_dtb214">Locke had a great influence on the French philosophers of the Enlightenment, and the famous debate on the "Molyneux problem" inspired the French philosopher Denis
                  Diderot (1713-1784) to make contact with blind people and later publish his experiences in a pamphlet, Lettre sur les Aveugles pour Ceux qui voient (A Letter to the Blind for Those
                  Who Can See). </span>
               <span id="doc4_dtb215">His letter served several purposes. </span>
               <span id="doc4_dtb216">On the one hand, Diderot exposed a fraud which had taken place in the drawing-room of the scientist S.A. </span>

                  <span id="doc4_dtb217">Réaumur , while on the other he made a number of observations which were a radical criticism of the conventional ideas of the time </span>

               </span>
               <span id="doc4_dtb220">The fraud in question consisted of a performance by a girl who claimed to be blind in Réaumur's drawing-room during which she played, sang and answered a series
                  of general knowledge questions (for example, the length of certain rivers, the names of European cities, etc.). </span>
               <span id="doc4_dtb221">Diderot unmasked this humbug, but also pointed out that fraudulent performances were unnecessary, since the blind could in fact be educated. </span>
               <span id="doc4_dtb222">As an example of this, he mentioned the blind English mathematician Nicholas Saunderson. </span>
               <span id="doc4_d910e1121">
                  <span id="doc4_dtb223">In the second half of his letter, Diderot has Saunderson express, in an imaginary dialogue, his own atheistic philosophy of life, for which Diderot paid with a

               <span id="doc4_dtb242">His father was a weaver. </span>

                  <span id="doc4_dtb243">Haüy's elder brother, the abbé René Just Haüy (1743-1822), was the pioneer of crystallography (the science of the structure, forms and property of crystals)
                     and played an important role in the introduction of the metric system </span>

               <span id="doc4_dtb246">In 1751, the family took up residence in Paris and the two brothers began to attend a school run by a Catholic order. </span>
               <span id="doc4_dtb247">Later, both of them studied at the Sorbonne; Valentin studied Latin, Greek and Hebrew and was said to be fluent in about ten modern languages. </span>
               <span id="doc4_dtb248">He earned a living as a translator of private and public documents and was soon able to boast the title of Royal Interpreter. </span>
               <span id="doc4_dtb249">He was also interpreter to the city council of Paris and the Admiralty. </span>
               <span id="doc4_dtb250">Before his appointment as royal interpreter he had become senior master in a secondary school. </span>

                  <span id="doc4_dtb251">He later became a member of the Bureau Académique des écritures, founded by Louis XVI, probably because he had invented a method of deciphering secret codes

               <span id="doc4_dtb254">In 1771, the French police began to take an interest in deciphering codes, and during the following ten years, Valentin Haüy worked for the secret police, where
                  his task was to investigate all foreign correspondence carried by the French postal service and to decipher secret documents. </span>
               <span id="doc4_dtb255">He continued these activities under the various revolutionary governments in the latter part of the century.</span>

               <span id="doc4_dtb328">If we compare this version of their meeting with Haüy's own words in section 3.3, we can guess how the story originated.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
               <span id="doc4_dtb329">Haüy started by teaching Lesueur good manners, grammatically correct speech and arithmetic. </span>
               <span id="doc4_dtb330">Haüy's main interest, however, was teaching the blind to read. </span>
               <span id="doc4_dtb331">He had wooden letters made so that Lesueur could learn the alphabet and later learn to read. </span>
               <span id="doc4_dtb332">This was achieved by forming the letters into words in a wooden frame. </span>
               <span id="doc4_dtb333">In a similar way, Lesueur learned the four arithmetical rules; in this case, wooden numbers were placed in different compartments in a frame. </span>
               <span id="doc4_dtb334">A major problem proved to be a supply of books for Lesueur. </span>
               <span id="doc4_dtb335">Haüy soon realised that his pupil could recognise raised letters, so he began to produce raised letters on waxed paper. </span>
               <span id="doc4_dtb336">Haüy had started teaching Lesueur on 31st May 1784. </span>
               <span id="doc4_d910e1626">

               <span id="doc4_dtb392">In his essay Haüy expounds his pedagogical theories and presents a programme of studies for blind children. </span>
               <span id="doc4_dtb393">His basic premise was that the "unfortunate Blind," who until then had been deprived of education, could in fact be educated and ought therefore to be given the
                  opportunity to attend school and learn a trade by which they could later make a living.</span>

            <p>
               <span id="doc4_dtb394">Each subject is dealt with in a short chapter. </span>
               <span id="doc4_dtb395">Haüy gives simple, practical advice on teaching methods and on the production of material for use in object lessons and of a variety of teaching aids.</span>

            <p>
               <span id="doc4_dtb396">He lays particular stress on the methods to be used to teach blind children to read and write and on how to produce raised print books. </span>
               <span id="doc4_dtb397">An entire chapter is dedicated to explaining how blind pupils can be trained as compositors. </span>
               <span id="doc4_dtb398">He also attempts to demonstrate that those blind pupils who did learn some kind of handicraft (at Quinze-Vingt, for example) were able to earn their own living. </span>
               <span id="doc4_dtb399">Haüy therefore recommends that teaching of the blind should include activities such as the production of walking sticks and hairnets, sewing, bookbinding,
                  etc.</span>

            <p>
               <span id="doc4_dtb400">Haüy also insists that blind pupils should study history, geography and music. </span>

                  blind and sighted children should be taught together and for this reason he does not agree with the use of special mathematical teaching aids for blind children. </span>
               <span id="doc4_dtb409">Haüy does recognise that blind pupils may need some kind of assistance when drawing geometrical figures, for example, and had paper templates for this

               <span id="doc4_dtb422">Haüy's method was, however, a form of printing, that is, it involved typographic composition, so to enable the blind to correspond with the sighted in a simpler
                  fashion, Haüy designed a "writing board" on which the writer wrote with a steel pen which had an undivided nib. </span>
               <span id="doc4_dtb423">His idea was that the blind person should write his letter by hand on the one side of a suitable type of paper. </span>

                     the blind in these two capitals and in other European cities. </span>
                  <span id="doc4_dtb535">When his finances were so depleted that he had to close down the Musée des Aveugles, a number of welcome invitations arrived, one of them from Tsar Alexander I

                  <span id="doc4_dtb541">According to Skrébitsky (1884), Alexander I employed a number of agents who informed him of every new idea that could successfully be introduced into Russia. </span>
                  <span id="doc4_dtb542">Negotiations with Haüy were arranged by General Hitrowo, and plans were drawn up for the creation of an institute for the blind in St Petersburg. </span>
                  <span id="doc4_dtb543">These plans show that Haüy had no intention of remaining in St Petersburg for any length of time. </span>
                  <span id="doc4_dtb544">The project basically involved:</span>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <span id="doc4_dtb545">1. </span>
                  <span id="doc4_dtb546">The supervision, in Paris, of the production of all the teaching material destined for use in the education and occupation of blind children and adults in
                     Russia. </span>
                  <span id="doc4_dtb547">Haüy promised to take with him to Russia educational material such as letters and numbers for reading, counting and printing, maps, writing boards, etc.</span>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <span id="doc4_dtb548">2. </span>
                  <span id="doc4_dtb549">Haüy would travel to Russia the following Spring (1804) and remain there for about a year, accompanied by one of his blind pupils who had been taught by his
                     methods. </span>
                  <span id="doc4_dtb550">Haüy believed that his visit would bring success to the new institute and the ideas behind it and that it would encourage competition amongst the young
                     Russians.</span>
               </p>

                     <span id="doc4_dtb552">Haüy, whose idea the project was, agreed to teach his methods faithfully to the person appointed by His Imperial Highness Alexander I to direct the St
                        Petersburg Institute for the Blind </span>

               <p>
                  <span id="doc4_dtb555">According to Skrébitsky, the Russian government asked Haüy's advice on the personal qualities and qualifications required of the new director of the St
                     Petersburg institute for the blind, and on the economic compensation Haüy was willing to accept to take on the responsibility of setting up the institute. </span>
                  <span id="doc4_dtb556">The Russian government also wanted to know how much the project would cost. </span>
                  <span id="doc4_dtb557">As to the necessary qualities and qualifications of the director of the institute, Haüy (according to Skrébitsky) would have answered that this person should
                     be selected from amongst those teachers who had a good knowledge of Russian and French and, if possible, German. </span>
                  <span id="doc4_dtb558">The Director must also have an elementary knowledge of practical activities such as spinning, knitting, the making of hairnets, different kinds of weaving,
                     etc. </span>
                  <span id="doc4_dtb559">Haüy furthermore pointed out that the director must be familiar with the art of printing if he was to fulfil his task. </span>
                  <span id="doc4_dtb560">Only an amateur's knowledge of music was required, however. </span>
                  <span id="doc4_dtb561">Haüy added that apart from these basic qualifications, the director must have a good head on his shoulders, be gentle and patient and have a love for mankind
                     in general.</span>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <span id="doc4_dtb562">Haüy asked his imperial highness for an annual salary of at least <span id="doc4_d910e2586" class="num-with-space">40 000</span> roubles, of which half would
                     be paid in advance when Haüy began his work. </span>
                  <span id="doc4_dtb563">He also asked the crown to provide, at no cost to himself, a furnished house, light and fuel.</span>
               </p>
               <span id="doc4_page_16" class="page-normal" epub:type="pagebreak" title="16"></span>
               <p>
                  <span id="doc4_dtb564">Finally, he asked for <span id="doc4_d910e2601" class="num-with-space">2 000</span> roubles in advance, as travel allowance for himself and his blind pupil. </span>
                  <span id="doc4_dtb565">Haüy did not ask for travel allowances for his wife and son, who accompanied him to Russia. </span>
                  <span id="doc4_dtb566">He estimated the costs of inventories, including teaching material such as maps and a globe, at <span id="doc4_d910e2610" class="num-with-space">4 500</span>
                     francs and the annual operating costs, including salaries, at <span id="doc4_d910e2613" class="num-with-space">54 700</span> francs. </span>
                  <span id="doc4_dtb567">The institute should be staffed by three teachers, one of them a music teacher, and a manager for the printing works.</span>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <span id="doc4_dtb568">Haüy estimated that costs would decrease as the pupils progressed in their activities. </span>
                  <span id="doc4_dtb569">This he based on his experience in Paris where his pupils, once they had acquired a certain degree of skill in handicrafts and printing were able to make a
                     profit for the institute. </span>
                  <span id="doc4_dtb570">Haüy was convinced that his experience in Paris could be transferred to St Petersburg, which shows how little he knew about the country he was about to
                     visit.</span>

                  <span id="doc4_dtb591">He wrote that he thought the Tsar would be interested in meeting a blind person who was not only skilled in a handicraft but could also read and write and was

               <p>
                  <span id="doc4_dtb596">Haüy's financial problems increased since none of the promises he had been given of compensation, a house, etc., were fulfilled. </span>
                  <span id="doc4_dtb597">On 11th October 1806, he wrote a petition to the Tsar in which he set out his complaints. </span>

                     <span id="doc4_dtb598">Skrébitsky says that he has found the letter in question and that it had a note in the margin (with a signature which probably belonged to the Minister of
                        the General Education, Count Zawadowsky) which read, "The Tsar ordered this bill to be paid, premises to be found for the institute and a director who would learn Haüy's

                  <span id="doc4_dtb602">The person who became head of the new institute for the blind was a certain Bouchoueff, who taught at a school in St Petersburg and claimed he was sufficiently
                     fluent in French to be able to converse with Haüy and learn his pedagogical ideas. </span>
                  <span id="doc4_dtb603">Bouchoueff was to live in Haüy's house. </span>
                  <span id="doc4_dtb604">A report from the ministry dated 10th March 1807 shows that Haüy employed two assistants to work with Bouchoueff and himself. </span>
                  <span id="doc4_dtb605">Fournier, Haüy's blind pupil, helped to instruct these assistants. </span>
                  <span id="doc4_dtb606">Haüy invited public officials and members of the Russian Academy of Science to be present during Fournier's lectures, hoping to enlist their support. </span>
                  <span id="doc4_dtb607">However, there were still no blind pupils. </span>
                  <span id="doc4_dtb608">Haüy was told that the lack of pupils arose from the fact that there were no blind people in Russia. </span>
                  <span id="doc4_dtb609">To this, Haüy replied:</span>

                  <span id="doc4_dtb618">In his quest for pupils, Haüy placed advertisements in Le Lycée, a review, and in the daily Gazette de Petersbourg. </span>

                  <span id="doc4_dtb621">Haüy went to Smolny where he found several blind children living with the aged and the handicapped inmates. </span>
                  <span id="doc4_dtb622">He took the son of the woman who had asked for his help back to St Petersburg with him and asked the authorities for permission to teach the other blind
                     children in Smolny. </span>
                  <span id="doc4_dtb623">The children were to be picked up by coach, in twos, and later returned to the asylum. </span>
                  <span id="doc4_dtb624">Haüy himself would undertake to teach the boys, while his wife would teach the little girls. </span>
                  <span id="doc4_dtb625">The director of the Smolny asylum, however, refused to give his permission. </span>
                  <span id="doc4_dtb626">Haüy then sent a written request to the "Committee for General Beneficence" and later to the "Civil Governor", who promised to grant Haüy's request as soon as
                     he found time to do so. </span>

                  <span id="doc4_dtb628">In the same document (dated 10th March 1807), Haüy also complained about his cramped lodgings which made it impossible for him to take in more than one blind
                     pupil at a time. </span>
                  <span id="doc4_dtb629">His other pupil, from Moscow, had to lodge elsewhere in the town. </span>
                  <span id="doc4_dtb630">Haüy asked the authorities to provide him with the house he had been promised to enable him to establish his school under more suitable conditions. </span>
                  <span id="doc4_d910e2877">
                     <span id="doc4_dtb631">In his letter Haüy also mentioned his two assistants and praised Bouchoueff, but complained about the latter's " weak health, which permitted him to
                        dedicate only half-days to studies which required at least a year of continuous dedication" </span>

               <p>
                  <span id="doc4_dtb634">Was it for tactical reasons that Haüy praised Bouchoueff, who obviously did not make any major contribution to the work of the institute? </span>
                  <span id="doc4_d910e2895">
                     <span id="doc4_dtb635">Haüy did not receive much help from his two assistants either, since they drank and turned out to be generally inept </span>
                     <a id="doc4_dtb636" epub:type="noteref" href="#doc7_fn_71">71</a>
                     <span id="doc4_dtb637">. </span>
                  </span>
                  <span id="doc4_dtb638">Two other persons, however, announced their interest in teaching at Haüy's school. </span>
                  <span id="doc4_dtb639">They were Galitch, a student at the Institute of Pedagogy in St Petersburg, and Louet, a French immigrant (a naturalized Russian citizen), who offered to give
                     music classes.</span>
               </p>
               <span id="doc4_page_18" class="page-normal" epub:type="pagebreak" title="18"></span>
               <p>
                  <span id="doc4_dtb640">Galitch taught a pupil who came from the Kronstadt fortress in the Bay of Finland and who spoke only Russian. </span>
                  <span id="doc4_dtb641">According to Skrébitsky, Bouchoueff had already lost heart in his work.</span>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <span id="doc4_dtb642">Haüy had intended to reproduce the printing works he had had at the Institution des Jeunes Aveugles. </span>
                  <span id="doc4_dtb643">A printing press was a major investment, but it had paid off well in Paris, and had, in fact, been the means of earning a regular income for the blind pupils
                     and the institute. </span>
                  <span id="doc4_dtb644">Haüy valued very highly the trades associated with printing. </span>
                  <span id="doc4_dtb645">In the document dated 10th March 1807, he asked permission to establish a printing works at the institute, where not only ordinary books and books in raised
                     print for the blind could be produced, but also such articles as visiting cards and other texts not subject to official censorship. </span>
                  <span id="doc4_dtb646">Finally, he asked to be given the use of one of the crown's empty buildings for his institute, and to be allowed to select young blind people who could benefit
                     from his teaching methods from the asylums, especially the Smolny asylum. </span>
                  <span id="doc4_dtb647">He also wished to appoint staff to take charge of the administration of the institute.</span>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <span id="doc4_dtb648">In his petition, Haüy also stressed that he had agreed to teach according to his methods for a period of one year, but that to date he had only been allowed to
                     teach one pupil. </span>
                  <span id="doc4_dtb649">By May 1807, Haüy still had no premises and once again sent a petition to the Minister of General Education in which he referred to former unfulfilled
                     promises. </span>
                  <span id="doc4_dtb650">He had been given a building, but it turned out to be unsuitable for a school. </span>
                  <span id="doc4_dtb651">He further mentioned that attempts were still being made to convince him that there were no blind people in Russia, but that he had seen the many blind beggars
                     for himself and had also seen many blind children in Smolny whom he would gladly teach.</span>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <span id="doc4_dtb652">It has already been said that Haüy did have a few pupils, one of whom lived in his house. </span>
                  <span id="doc4_dtb653">As there was no reaction from the minister, Haüy, who now only had four months of his contract left, decided to occupy the building offered in spite of the
                     fact that it was not in a fit condition to house a school. </span>
                  <span id="doc4_dtb654">Bouchoueff was still unwell and of little use to him. </span>
                  <span id="doc4_dtb655">His two assistants, Galitch and Louet, however, did an excellent job.</span>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <span id="doc4_dtb656">Once again Haüy asked to be allowed to select some blind children from the Smolny asylum as pupils. </span>
                  <span id="doc4_dtb657">Skrébitsky states that he found no answer to this letter, although he did discover a decision by the tsar, dated 10th August 1807, giving Haüy permission to
                     teach 15 pupils at an annual cost of <span id="doc4_d910e2986" class="num-with-space">14 150</span> roubles with an extra allowance of <span id="doc4_d910e2989"
                        class="num-with-space">5 185</span> roubles, but this did not solve Haüy's problems. </span>
                  <span id="doc4_dtb658">Now the authorities concerned began to harass him and demand that he should deduct the amount granted from what he had previously received. </span>
                  <span id="doc4_dtb659">In addition, a heated debate ensued on the carriage required by Haüy to transport his purchases to the institute. </span>
                  <span id="doc4_dtb660">The discussion ended when the tsar ordered General Hitrowo to tell Haüy to conduct himself in a proper manner.</span>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <span id="doc4_dtb661">Prior to that curt, rather perfunctory decision, Baron Dolst, director of secondary schools, had been ordered to inspect Haüy's school. </span>
                  <span id="doc4_dtb662">The inspection was preceded by a letter from Haüy to the minister of education, in which he wrote:</span>
               </p>
               <blockquote id="doc4_dtb663">

                        I answer that this is quite correct but that the note referred to clearly states that there were two conditions: 1. </span>
                     <span id="doc4_dtb665">That I would be given a sufficient number of blind pupils;2. </span>

                  <span id="doc4_dtb678">This letter clearly shows that at this time relations between Haüy and Bouchoueff were extremely strained.</span>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <span id="doc4_dtb679">Baron Dolst admitted in his report after his inspection of the institute (13th August 1808) that the premises to which it had moved were not suitable, located
                     as they were on the fourth floor, with the dormitories next to the earth closets. </span>
                  <span id="doc4_dtb680">As to the teaching at the institute, Dolst affirmed that he could find no differences in knowledge between the pupils taught by Haüy and those taught by
                     Bouchoueff. </span>
                  <span id="doc4_dtb681">He did find that a few pupils had made considerable progress in reading after following Haüy's methods, but that printing had had to be abandoned for lack of
                     typecast. </span>
                  <span id="doc4_dtb682">Basket-making and straw plaiting for chair bottoms were taught at the institute; the girls learned how to make hairnets and to knit. </span>
                  <span id="doc4_dtb683">Dolst considered that the teaching of handicrafts had achieved good results.</span>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <span id="doc4_dtb684">As for the teaching of music, however, Dolst was not satisfied. </span>
                  <span id="doc4_dtb685">The children had learnt only three French and two Italian songs. </span>
                  <span id="doc4_dtb686">The Baron did not find this lack of progress so remarkable, since the songs were all in foreign languages. </span>
                  <span id="doc4_dtb687">He therefore suggested that the immigrant Louet should be replaced by a Russian music teacher who would be assisted by a blind person by the name of
                     Shiline.</span>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <span id="doc4_dtb688">After the inspection, Haüy asked Dolst if he might hand in his resignation and leave the institute together with Fournier and Louet. </span>
                  <span id="doc4_dtb689">Dolst submitted Haüy's letter of resignation to the minister of education. </span>
                  <span id="doc4_dtb690">In it he asked to be relieved of his duties because of the serious conflict between himself and Bouchoueff.</span>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <span id="doc4_dtb691">According to Skrébitsky, neither Dolst's report nor Haüy's letter of resignation had any effect, and Haüy continued as head of the institute until 1817. </span>
                  <span id="doc4_dtb692">Bouchoueff, too, retained his post at the institute and shortly afterwards disbanded the girls' section (which consisted of three pupils).</span>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <span id="doc4_dtb693">Skrébitsky claims to have found notes by an anonymous writer in one of the archives. </span>
                  <span id="doc4_dtb694">These notes proved that the original intention was to admit two categories of pupils to the institute: the poor, who would learn reading, writing, typesetting,
                     music and handicrafts, and the well-to-do, who would learn writing, geography, poetry, etc. </span>
                  <span id="doc4_dtb695">Religion would be a compulsory subject for both social groups.</span>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <span id="doc4_dtb696">The author of the note was of the opinion that the Rosminazoffs' house, where the institute was located, was very suitable in spite of the fact that both Baron
                     Dolst and Haüy thought the contrary. </span>
                  <span id="doc4_dtb697">He was also very critical of Haüy, who he found had made improper use of his position by appropriating the best rooms for his own personal use.</span>
               </p>
               <span id="doc4_page_20" class="page-normal" epub:type="pagebreak" title="20"></span>
               <p>
                  <span id="doc4_dtb698">The children's dormitory was cold in winter and stiflingly hot in summer. </span>
                  <span id="doc4_dtb699">To make matters worse, they were obliged to pass through the bedroom to empty their chamber pots. </span>
                  <span id="doc4_dtb700">Music classes, study and a variety of activities were held in the general classroom while normal classes were going on. </span>
                  <span id="doc4_dtb701">At one table, pupils were taught reading or grammar, at another arithmetic. </span>
                  <span id="doc4_dtb702">The space for printing works was in one corner, while in the centre of the room, pupils played the piano or the violin. </span>
                  <span id="doc4_dtb703">The anonymous author added that Haüy's son or his pupil Fournier sometimes amused themselves by adding to the general noise by starting up the lathe in order
                     to disturb the Russian teachers at their work, and so that later they would be able to criticise their methods.</span>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <span id="doc4_dtb704">The unknown critic also took a very negative view of the teaching of handicrafts. </span>
                  <span id="doc4_dtb705">It had, for example, taken a whole year to teach a pupil to plait and the finished result was a mere half archine which would only fetch 10 kopeks. </span>
                  <span id="doc4_dtb706">He also noted that the printing press was used only to print brochures about Haüy's telegraph, with the result that the type was worn and could not be used for
                     its original purpose. </span>
                  <span id="doc4_dtb707">The author accused Fournier, who was in charge of these activities, of deliberately destroying the type. </span>
                  <span id="doc4_dtb708">The lathe was in equally bad shape, the music teaching deficient, etc. </span>
                  <span id="doc4_dtb709">The author ends by suggesting that the French teachers should be dismissed and replaced by Russians.</span>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <span id="doc4_dtb710">Haüy very much resented what he considered to be harassment which Skrébitsky believes Bouchoueff was responsible for. </span>
                  <span id="doc4_dtb711">In a letter dated 19th August 1808, Haüy asked Count Zawadowsky (the minister of education) to order Baron Dolst to continue his inspections and demanded that
                     examinations should be held in French in the presence of witnesses. </span>
                  <span id="doc4_dtb712">Haüy wanted to be able to refute any criticism which might be made of his work and had no desire to be at the mercy of the caprice of a single judge. </span>
                  <span id="doc4_dtb713">This letter was followed by another to Baron Dolst, in which Haüy asked to be allowed to participate in decisions concerning the final organisation of the
                     institute. </span>
                  <span id="doc4_dtb714">He yet again asked to be moved to more suitable premises and requested a list of poor blind children who might be admitted to the institute and another of
                     well-to-do children who might be potential pupils.</span>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <span id="doc4_dtb715">Bouchoueff died before Haüy left Russia. </span>
                  <span id="doc4_dtb716">According to Skrébitsky, there are no sources which might explain why Haüy stayed in Russia for as long as eleven years, in spite of all adversities. </span>
                  <span id="doc4_dtb717">An official document dated 6th May 1817 makes it clear that Haüy wished to leave the institute. </span>
                  <span id="doc4_dtb718">It is a letter is addressed to Prince Galitzin (who had replaced Zawadowsky as minister of education). </span>
                  <span id="doc4_dtb719">In it, Haüy asks to be removed from office or to be granted six months leave for himself and Fournier. </span>
                  <span id="doc4_dtb720">As Haüy was in a state of ill health by this time, Galitzin agreed to his dismissal, stating that he would thus be able to end his days in the bosom of his
                     family. </span>
                  <span id="doc4_dtb721">The French ambassador requested permission to take Haüy and Fournier back to France aboard a warship which was soon to leave. </span>
                  <span id="doc4_dtb722">The Tsar gave his approval to the application and on Haüy's departure decorated him with the Order of Saint Vladimir, fourth class.</span>

               <p>
                  <span id="doc4_dtb738">At an early date, Haüy had become interested in the abbé l'épée's teaching of the deaf. </span>
                  <span id="doc4_dtb739">Skrébitsky (1884) says that in 1784, the abbé l'épée on one occasion himself entrusted Haüy with the teaching of a deaf person. </span>
                  <span id="doc4_dtb740">Skrébitsky's source was probably a footnote in Haüy's Essai sur l'Education des Aveugles. </span>
                  <span id="doc4_dtb741">In one chapter, Haüy writes that he wished to compare the teaching of the blind with that of the deaf. </span>
                  <span id="doc4_dtb742">This chapter, however, is mainly a panegyric dedicated to the abbé l'épée. </span>
                  <span id="doc4_dtb743">In passing, however, Haüy says that he can testify to the fact that it is much easier to teach the blind than the deaf. </span>
                  <span id="doc4_dtb744">In the footnote mentioned, Haüy states that he had had the opportunity of following the progress of a young deaf man who had been shipwrecked and washed ashore
                     on the coast of Normandy. </span>
                  <span id="doc4_dtb745">Haüy also promised that the partially deaf man would write his autobiography and that his blind pupils would print it. </span>
                  <span id="doc4_dtb746">That promise, to the best of my knowledge, was never kept.</span>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <span id="doc4_dtb747">In October 1807, a Russian lady approached Haüy and asked him to teach her deaf daughter. </span>
                  <span id="doc4_dtb748">According to Skrébitsky's sources, Haüy commented on this as follows:</span>
               </p>
               <blockquote id="doc4_dtb749">
                  <p>

                     <span id="doc4_dtb751">In vain I tried to dissuade her, on the pretext of my lack of practical experience of this difficult art, which often surpasses the capacity of even the

                     <span id="doc4_dtb752">Eventually I had to give in and accept. </span>
                     <span id="doc4_dtb753">The very limited progress I made with her soon attracted attention and further pupils were sent to me."</span>

                     in France. </span>
                  <span id="doc4_dtb756">His work aroused great surprise and admiration, although there were also sceptics. </span>

            <span id="doc5_d910e3743">
               <span id="doc5_dtb831">Another pioneer in this field was Johan Wilhelm Klein, who in 1804 founded an institute for the blind in Vienna </span>

               <span id="doc5_dtb836"> and his real wish was to integrate blind children into ordinary classes. </span>
            </span>
            <span id="doc5_dtb837">Klein's institute was from the outset financed by the State, while the institute which Haüy and Zeune founded in Berlin in 1806 also received State funds.</span>

            </span>
            <span id="doc5_dtb841">At that time, the Keeper of Royal Records, Pär Aron Borg, received a visit from the 24- year old Charlotta Seijerling, who had become blind at the age of four and
               later boarded with the Borg family where she was taught music, writing, arithmetic, German, French, etc. </span>

                  describes the public examination of Charlotta Seijerling, who was able to demonstrate her skill in reading, singing, playing the piano and the harp and also in "a number of
                  handicrafts, which she had been taught such as spinning, knitting and needlework; and she had, particularly in the latter crafts, acquired such skill that she was able to show a
                  sweater which she had made for herself". </span>

            <span id="doc5_dtb846">Borg points out that he had only been able to teach her in his "spare moments" and that Seijerling would probably have achieved much better results if she had been

         <p>
            <span id="doc5_dtb847">After this public examination, Borg asked the king, King Gustav IV Adolf, to contribute financially to extending the institute's activities so that greater numbers
               of blind persons could be taught. </span>
            <span id="doc5_dtb848">In his letter to the king, he also requested permission to teach the deaf. </span>

               <span id="doc5_dtb869">During the parliamentary session of 1844 to 1845, education for the disabled was discussed, and in the course of that debate it was in fact suggested that this

            <span id="doc5_dtb873">In this debate, Zellén particularly emphasised the element of self-sufficiency and referred to the fact that most civilised countries in Europe had developed a

            <span id="doc5_dtb907">Johansen states that in 1810 the Kjaeden Order was interested in expanding its activities and that one of its members, Brother C.F. </span>

            <span id="doc5_dtb909">Frederick VI supported the project and personally contributed funds towards it. </span>
            <span id="doc5_dtb910">He himself inaugurated the institute and named it "The Royal Institute for the Blind". </span>
            <span id="doc5_dtb911">Johansen could find no evidence to indicate that Fürst was a member of the Kjaeden Order, although he did find proof that he had approached Brorson after the
               creation of the institute for the blind and offered to teach there without compensation. </span>
            <span id="doc5_dtb912">The institute's curriculum included reading and writing and Fürst is said to have taught those subjects. </span>
            <span id="doc5_dtb913">Johansen, however, believes that education at the institute could not have been very successful, as Brorson was a decided opponent of the purchase of a printing
               press for the production of raised print books. </span>
            <span id="doc5_dtb914">The Danish Museum for the Blind, in spite of this opposition to the printing press, contains both a typographic case produced by Haüy and a copy of his famous essay. </span>
            <span id="doc5_dtb915">Were they perhaps Fürst's? </span>
            <span id="doc5_dtb916">Is the book one of the three copies Castberg bought in Paris? </span>
            <span id="doc5_dtb917">These questions remain unanswered. </span>
            <span id="doc5_dtb918">In the 1850s, management of the institute was taken over by the State. </span>
            <span id="doc5_dtb919">Nationalisation was preceded by a commission headed by Professor N.G. </span>
            <span id="doc5_dtb920">Melchior who had visited the institute in Paris in 1852 and seen for himself that blind pupils could learn to read with the help of raised print books. </span>
            <span id="doc5_d910e4106">

            </span>
            <span id="doc5_dtb924">As a result of Melchior's report, the commission suggested that the institute should employ special teachers to teach the blind pupils to read and write. </span>
            <span id="doc5_dtb925">They should learn not only to write in ink in order to be able to communicate with the sighted, but also the Braille system so that they could communicate with one
               another. </span>
            <span id="doc5_dtb926">It was further suggested in the report that in their own interest blind children should be taught in their local school during their early years. </span>
            <span id="doc5_dtb927">They would then be admitted to the Institute for the Blind at the age of eleven.</span>

            <span id="doc5_dtb929">In 1855, Haüy's Essai sur l'Education des Aveugles was translated into Danish by a young blind man by the name of Hans S/ondring. </span>
            <span id="doc5_dtb930">The Danish translation was called Om de Blinde (About the Blind). </span>
            <span id="doc5_dtb931">The National Institute for the Blind was inaugurated in 1856; the Kjaeden Order's final contribution to the education of blind children was to assume the costs of
               the new school building. </span>
            <span id="doc5_dtb932">The Order is still in existence and funds research into the history of the blind. </span>
            <span id="doc5_dtb933">From all this, it is obvious that Haüy's methods did not reach Denmark until the middle of the 19th century, in spite of Fürst's activities.</span>

         <h1 id="doc6_d910e4162">5. Discussion and conclusions</h1>
         <p>
            <span id="doc6_dtb936">In Chapter 1, I posed a number of questions. </span>
            <span id="doc6_dtb937">Have I answered them successfully?</span>
         </p>
         <p>
            <span id="doc6_dtb938">By contrasting information from different sources, I have managed to compile a biography of Valentin Haüy. </span>
            <span id="doc6_dtb939">During my studies, further questions emerged:</span>
         </p>
         <p>
            <span id="doc6_dtb940">- What factors can be said to have determined Haüy's abandoning his work as a translator and interpreter in order to dedicate his efforts to the education of the
               blind?</span>
         </p>
         <p>
            <span id="doc6_dtb941">My answer is: There were probably several factors involved. </span>
            <span id="doc6_dtb942">We can assume that the first proof Haüy had that the disabled were educable was when he witnessed deaf pupils from the abbé l'épée's institute performing in public. </span>
            <span id="doc6_dtb943">As he himself said, his encounter with the blind musicians at the St Ovid market was of decisive importance to his commitment to the blind. </span>
            <span id="doc6_dtb944">That incident may in fact be seen as an epiphany (moment of revelation), a turning-point in Haüy's life. </span>
            <span id="doc6_dtb945">Another such critical incident was his meeting with Lésueur. </span>
            <span id="doc6_dtb946">Denzin (1989) in Engström (1995), describes epiphanies as "interactional moments and experiences which leave marks on people's lives".</span>
         </p>
         <p>
            <span id="doc6_dtb947">- What is the characteristic feature of Haüy's life?</span>
         </p>
         <p>
            <span id="doc6_dtb948">If I dared to classify Haüy's life at all, I would say that in many ways it was dramatic. </span>
            <span id="doc6_dtb949">Initially, Haüy appears to have been a monarchist, but at the same time he belonged to the Age of Enlightenment. </span>
            <span id="doc6_dtb950">Louis XVI was his benefactor, and in fact Haüy's pedagogic work, Essai sur l'education des aveugles, is dedicated to him. </span>
            <span id="doc6_dtb951">Later, Haüy became an active revolutionary. </span>
            <span id="doc6_dtb952">But is this so remarkable? </span>
            <span id="doc6_d910e4242">
               <span id="doc6_dtb953">He moved in precisely those circles - mainly composed of academics and public officials - from which the French Revolution sprang </span>
               <a id="doc6_dtb954" epub:type="noteref" href="#doc7_fn_98">98</a>
               <span id="doc6_dtb955">.</span>
            </span>
         </p>
         <p>
            <span id="doc6_dtb956">Haüy's behaviour to Sicard was certainly not particularly friendly, but on the other hand, Sicard had his revenge when he denounced Haüy to the police. </span>
            <span id="doc6_dtb957">In any case, it would seem that Haüy's activities during the French Revolution did not perturb Alexander I or Louis XVIII to any great degree.</span>
         </p>
         <p>
            <span id="doc6_dtb958">Haüy was also a utilitarian (a term coined by Jeremy Bentham). </span>
            <span id="doc6_dtb959">He believed wholeheartedly that the blind should taught to be self-sufficient. </span>
            <span id="doc6_dtb960">This utilitarian view characterised teaching of the blind for a long time and is still the basis of education for the blind in the <abbr
                  title="United States of America" id="doc6_d910e4274" epub:type="z3998:acronym" class="spell-out">USA</abbr>, Canada and several Asian countries where the aim of the education for the
               blind is that they should eventually be able to fend for themselves in life. </span>
            <span id="doc6_d910e4278">
               <span id="doc6_dtb961">Haüy does not stand alone amongst his contemporaries in taking this utilitarian view of education for the visually impaired: it was characteristic of all teaching
                  during the period of the French Revolution </span>
               <a id="doc6_dtb962" epub:type="noteref" href="#doc7_fn_99">99</a>
               <span id="doc6_dtb963">.</span>
            </span>
         </p>
         <p>
            <span id="doc6_dtb964">- Can we rightly call Haüy the father of education for the blind?</span>
         </p>
         <p>
            <span id="doc6_dtb965">I have shown that experimentation in education for visually impaired pupils originated in several countries; there are thus several persons, contemporaries of Haüy,
               who might well be called pioneers of education for the blind.</span>
         </p>
         <span id="doc6_page_27" class="page-normal" epub:type="pagebreak" title="27"></span>
         <p>
            <span id="doc6_dtb966">Pritchard (1963), however, emphasises that Haüy was unique in that he created a system of organised education for the blind based on a carefully thought-out method. </span>
            <span id="doc6_dtb967">The outstanding feature of Haüy's enterprise - which sets him apart from British pedagogues of the time - was the founding of a school in the true sense, which
               imparted free education to all blind children, regardless of sex or social class. </span>
            <span id="doc6_dtb968">A pupil did not have to be rich or highly intelligent to be admitted to his school. </span>
            <span id="doc6_dtb969">All previous attempts at educating the visually handicapped had been limited to children of well-to-do families and a few "blind child prodigies". </span>
            <span id="doc6_dtb970">Haüy was also a pioneer of integration and equal opportunities. </span>
            <span id="doc6_dtb971">At the Paris institute, blind and sighted children were taught side by side. </span>
            <span id="doc6_dtb972">Haüy was convinced that his blind pupils, in time, would be capable of teaching the sighted. </span>
            <span id="doc6_dtb973">Furthermore, Haüy's methods involved co-education, which must be considered quite radical for the time. </span>
            <span id="doc6_dtb974">Haüy was, too, a pioneer of education for young children; he was teaching small children at the Musée des Aveugles long before Fröbel founded his school at Kilham in
               Germany in 1816. </span>
            <span id="doc6_dtb975">The idea of integration crops up repeatedly in his Essai sur l'Education des Aveugles. </span>
            <span id="doc6_dtb976">He insisted in postponing for as long as possible the use of special teaching aids for the blind in such subjects as arithmetic since he wished the blind and the
               sighted to be taught together.</span>
         </p>
         <p>
            <span id="doc6_dtb977">One of the most basic elements in the education of the blind is the teaching of reading and writing. </span>
            <span id="doc6_dtb978">Today we describe visual impairment as "an information handicap". </span>
            <span id="doc6_dtb979">Haüy's greatest claim to fame is that he genuinely attempted to solve this enormous obstacle to learning by producing raised print books.</span>
         </p>
         <p>
            <span id="doc6_dtb980">Folke Johansen (1983) believes that Valentin Haüy's raised letters were very difficult to read, but that his printing method was a unique invention. </span>
            <span id="doc6_dtb981">It remained in use until modern computer technology made it possible to produce tactile writing. </span>
            <span id="doc6_d910e4364">
               <span id="doc6_dtb982">Indeed, Haüy has sometimes been called "The Gutenberg of the Blind" </span>
               <a id="doc6_dtb983" epub:type="noteref" href="#doc7_fn_100">100</a>

            <span id="doc6_d910e4379">
               <span id="doc6_dtb985">Haüy was not a pioneer of object lessons for blind children, although he did continue what others before him had begun </span>
               <a id="doc6_dtb986" epub:type="noteref" href="#doc7_fn_101">101</a>
               <span id="doc6_dtb987">. </span>
            </span>
            <span id="doc6_dtb988">He was more practical in his approach to the problems involved in educating blind children, producing useful material and equipment (such as his printing press)
               which he exported to other institutes for the blind in Europe.</span>
         </p>
         <p>
            <span id="doc6_dtb989">Chapter 4 demonstrates Haüy's indirect influence on education for the blind in Sweden and Denmark in the early 19th century. </span>
            <span id="doc6_dtb990">Pär Aron Borg was unwilling to recognise that he had learned anything from other pedagogues, although we find ample evidence that he was in fact influenced by Haüy. </span>
            <span id="doc6_dtb991">In Denmark, Brorson consciously opposed Haüy's ideas when he refused to introduce his methods of teaching the blind to read and write. </span>
            <span id="doc6_dtb992">In the wider perspective, however, it is clearly the case that Haüy's teaching methods formed the basis of the organised education of the blind which developed in
               the Nordic countries in the 1850s and 1860s. </span>
            <span id="doc6_dtb993">A general interest in the education of blind children in Sweden and Denmark is not evident, however, before the introduction of elementary schooling.</span>
         </p>
         <p>
            <span id="doc6_dtb994">Pierre Henri (1987) suggests that Haüy's teaching methods were in many aspects rather naïve and indicated serious deficiencies in his knowledge of the blind. </span>
            <span id="doc6_dtb995">Henri underlines the fact that Haüy's successor and critic, Guillé, in his Essai sur l'instruction des aveugles, ou exposé analytique des procédés employés pour les
               instruire (1819) developed a much more sophisticated theoretical approach to the education of the blind. </span>
            <span id="doc6_d910e4422">
               <span id="doc6_dtb996">While he was director of the institute, however, Guillé did not increase the number of textbooks or teaching aids for use in object lessons </span>
               <a id="doc6_dtb997" epub:type="noteref" href="#doc7_fn_102">102</a>
               <span id="doc6_dtb998">.</span>

         </p>
         <span id="doc6_page_28" class="page-normal" epub:type="pagebreak" title="28"></span>
         <p>
            <span id="doc6_dtb999">Then we come to the question: Did Haüy in fact found an institute for the blind in St Petersburg?</span>
         </p>
         <p>
            <span id="doc6_dtb1000">It is clear that during his stay in Russia Haüy did found a school for the blind in St Petersburg in spite of considerable difficulties, one of which was the fact
               that he had no knowledge of the Russian language. </span>
            <span id="doc6_dtb1001">I ask myself how a man who was said to possess a gift for languages and who was fluent, it was also said, in ten or so modern languages, could have travelled to
               Russia without knowing any Russian, although it is possible that he learned the language during the period which Skrébitsky was unable to document (1811-1817). </span>
            <span id="doc6_dtb1002">It is highly probable that Haüy's difficulties in Russia were in fact caused by his lack of knowledge of Russian and by the fact that he was not familiar with the
               religion or culture of that country. </span>
            <span id="doc6_dtb1003">One illustration of his lack of knowledge of Russian society is that he tried to teach blind students to play the organ while in St Petersburg, in his ignorance of
               the fact that organ music does not form part of the Greek Orthodox Church's rites. </span>
            <span id="doc6_dtb1004">Skrébitsky (1884) also believes that Haüy was completely taken in by the public officials at the ministry and became a victim of Russian bureaucracy.</span>
         </p>
         <p>
            <span id="doc6_dtb1005">Skrébitsky proves that Haüy brought his wife and son to Russia although he never requested any extra travel allowance for them. </span>
            <span id="doc6_dtb1006">Madame Haüy remains a mystery and it is impossible to judge her contribution as a teacher. </span>
            <span id="doc6_d910e4470">
               <span id="doc6_dtb1007">All we know is that she taught at both the Musée des Aveugles </span>
               <a id="doc6_dtb1008" epub:type="noteref" href="#doc7_fn_103">103</a>
               <span id="doc6_dtb1009"> and the institute in St Petersburg.</span>
            </span>
         </p>
         <p>
            <span id="doc6_dtb1010">Finally, I am convinced that this brief outline of the life of Valentin Haüy demonstrates beyond doubt his importance in the history of education of the blind and
               that he is truly worthy to be called "the father of education for the blind".</span>
         </p>
         <p>
            <span id="doc6_dtb1011">The Riksdag (Swedish parliament) and the government's policy concerning handicapped children towards the end of the 1970s and early 1980s stated, amongst other
               things, that the latter should be integrated into the general educational system. </span>
            <span id="doc6_dtb1012">Underlying this policy is a belief in equality and fraternity, two of the fundamental values of the Enlightenment. </span>
            <span id="doc6_dtb1013">The Swedish government recently presented the draft of a proposed law (pro. 1999/2000:79) to the Riksdag: Från patient till medborgare - en nationell handlingsplan
               för handikappolitiken (From patient to citizen - a national policy for the handicapped). </span>
            <span id="doc6_dtb1014">This was a consequence of Sweden's adoption of the <abbr title="United Nations" id="doc6_d910e4503" epub:type="z3998:acronym" class="spell-out">UN</abbr> standard
               legislation on the right of the handicapped to participation and equality and other amendments to the Declaration of Human Rights. </span>
            <span id="doc6_dtb1015">Haüy's ideas on integration and participation in society were thus strikingly modern.</span>
